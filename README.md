## _Social Science Research_

Below, we provide the files to replicate the analyses and the files to replicate the experimental protocols for Experiments 1 and 2. Please reach out to the first author bianca.manago@vanderbilt.edu with any questions, comments, or concerns.

## Experimental Replication Files
Here are the experimental replication files for the manuscript.

### _Experiment 1_
Experiment 1 was conducted in zTree and you can access those files for all conditions [here](https://github.com/biancamanago/mtc_2022_SSR_replication-files/blob/94b2681d0e2a531bb1d714b11242dc276a7f439c/ztree.zip).
The experimental conditions are listed in the file names, see below for naming conventions. 


### _Experiment 2_
Experiment 2 was conducted on qualtrics. The [.qsf file](https://github.com/biancamanago/mtc_2022_SSR_replication-files/blob/125698aa203e18104ac4ee5d22f7a08eabb91f29/mtc-E2-SSR_Replication.qsf) allows you to conduct the same study without any additional programming.

## Naming Conventions
E1 indicates Experiment 1.
E2 indicates Experiment 2.

### _Illness Names_
- SAD = Social Awareness Disorder
- EAD = Erratic Affect Disorder

### _Label vs. Behavior_
- Behavior = Behavior only conditions
- Label = Label only conditions
- Both = Behavior and label conditions
